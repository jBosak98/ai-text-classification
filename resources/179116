er in response to that kind of provocation.
 
Such a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions
with the result of the police trying to take the place by
force and the result being the death of the hostages and the
gunmen. However, this is the first time I've heard of
the blame landing squarely on the police.
 
In this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down
from terrorists and hostage takers since that only encourages
other terrorists and hostage takers.
